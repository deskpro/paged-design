    <h1>Book CSS</h1>

    <p class="tagline">Customisable themes for book design with CSS</p>

    <p>Are you creating books with HTML and CSS? CSS files for books can be long and complicated to write. Our themes give you a head start: pick a theme for your book, add it to your project, and customise it to suit your needs.</p>

    <h2>Themes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beatrix:</strong> named for Ms Potter, a classic children's book theme for simple stories. Goes well with <a href="content/alice-in-wonderland/index.html?theme=beatrix"><em>Alice in Wonderland</em></a>.
            <a class="button" href="packaged/beatrix.zip">Download</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Density:</strong> a space-age look for big books. Goes well with <a href="content/the-future-of-ideas/index.html?theme=density"><em>The Future of Ideas</em> by Lawrence Lessig</a>.
            <a class="button" href="packaged/density.zip">Download</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Plastered:</strong> a wild and wonky look for grabbing attention. Goes well with <a href="content/little-brother/index.html?theme=plastered"><em>Little Brother</em> by Cory Doctorow</a>.
            <a class="button" href="packaged/plastered.zip">Download</a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Template:</strong> a plain template with very few opinions, and the starting place for creating brand new themes. Goes well with <a href="content/samples/index.html?theme=template">our typography samples</a>.
            <a class="button" href="packaged/template.zip">Download</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are just a small start. If you're interested in more themes, <a href="https://electricbookworks.com/contact">tell us</a> so that we know it's worth investing time in more theme development.</p>

    <h2>Sample content</h2>

    <p>This demo site includes four pieces of sample content for seeing themes at work:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="content/samples/index.html?theme=template">A book of sample features common to most books</a></li>
        <li><a href="content/alice-in-wonderland/index.html?theme=beatrix">Alice in Wonderland</a></li>
        <li><a href="content/little-brother/index.html?theme=plastered">The first chapter of Little Brother, by Cory Doctorow</a></li>
        <li><a href="content/the-future-of-ideas/index.html?theme=density">The first chapter of The Future of Ideas, by Lawrence Lessig</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For each one, use the theme-selector dropdown to see the browser lay out the book before your eyes. (Only Chrome can get this right currently.)</p>

    <h2>How to use a theme</h2>

    <h3>Setting up</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>You'll need to have NodeJS installed on your computer. Our themes are written in Sass, and you'll use Node to build that into your finished CSS.</li>
        <li>Download a theme package and unzip it.</li>
        <li>Place the unzipped <code>book-css</code> package in your project. We're assuming that your project is contained in a single folder (like a Git repo).</li>
        <li>In the <code>head</code> of your HTML (the content of your book), link to the compiled CSS file in your new theme folder. The path will depend on your folder structure, for example <code>../book-css/css/themes/beatrix/main.css</code>:<br>
            <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../book-css/css/themes/beatrix/main.css"&gt;</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>In the <code>head</code> of your HTML, link to the <code>paged.js</code> script, which will lay out your pages in Chrome. For instance, if you want to always link to the latest official version:
            <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/pagedjs/dist/paged.polyfill.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Serve your HTML. For example, if you're using Node and have http-server installed, you can run <code>npm run http-server -p 5000</code> in your project root folder, and visit your site at <a href="http://localhost:5000">http://localhost:5000</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    Now that you're up and running, you can customise your theme.

    <h3>Customising a theme</h3>

    <p>Once you're set up:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Install dependencies for <code>book-css</code>. From the command line, in the <code>book-css</code> folder, enter:</p>

            <p><code>npm install</code></p>

            <p>which will install a few modules to <code>node_modules</code> that we need in that folder.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Start our Node script to watch for changes to your styles. Still in the <code>book-css</code> folder at the command line, run:</p>

            <p><code>npm buildcss</code></p>

            <p>Node Sass will now the wathcing for changes. Every time you change a file in <code>build-css</code>, your compiled CSS will automatically update and you only need to refresh your browser to see your new styles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Set your selectors for book features in <code>book-css/themes/YOURTHEME/_selectors.scss</code> (where <code>YOURTHEME</code> is the name of the theme youâ€™ve downloaded).</li>
        <li>Set any new values for design variables in <code>book-css/themes/YOURTHEME/_variables.scss</code>. See the template for variables you can set.</li>
        <li>Add your own Sass/CSS styles to <code>book-css/themes/YOURTHEME/_styles.scss</code>.</li>
    </ol>
